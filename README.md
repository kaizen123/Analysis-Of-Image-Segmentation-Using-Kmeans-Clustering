# Analysis-Of-Image-Segmentation-Using-Kmeans-Clustering
There are many image segmentation techniques to partition a digital image into segments available nowadays such as Thresholding, Clustering methods, Compression-based methods etc. But we found that some methods, especially K-Means clustering and are not working perfectly in some circumstances of image segmentation process.
There are two main problems that affect the performance of these two image segmentation methods. One of the problems is that a general K-Mean algorithm cannot correctly and automatically generate the value of K, which determines how many clusters will be segmented for the image. Randomly picking it will get us a value thatâ€™s either too big or too small. In this case, some images, that have a relatively small RGB scale, may be over segmented.
The proposed method is compared with the other clustering based image segmentation method using the evaluation indices, RMSE and PSNR values and it validated the effectiveness of the proposed method
